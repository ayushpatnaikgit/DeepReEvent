    """
    Trains and validates a PyTorch model specifically designed for datasets involving recurrent events and terminal events.

    Parameters:
    model (torch.nn.Module): The PyTorch model to train.
    train_dataloader (torch.utils.data.DataLoader): DataLoader for training data, expected to yield batches in the form
        of (features, times, recurrent_events, censoring_indicators).
    val_dataloader (torch.utils.data.DataLoader): DataLoader for validation data, formatted the same as the training data.
    loss_function (function): The loss function to use, suitable for handling the complexities of recurrent and terminal event data.
    optimizer (torch.optim.Optimizer): The optimizer to use for training.
    num_epochs (int): Number of epochs to train the model.
    patience (int): Patience for early stopping (number of epochs to wait after last improvement).
    print_every (int): Frequency of epochs to print training updates (default is every 5 epochs).

    Notes:
    - `recurrent_events` (e): A tensor indicating the times of recurrent events for each individual. These times are used
      to calculate part of the loss function specific to recurrent events.
    - `censoring_indicators` (d): A binary tensor (0 or 1) indicating whether an event was observed (1) or censored (0).
      This is crucial for calculating the loss related to the terminal event, where censoring plays a significant role.

    Returns:
    None
