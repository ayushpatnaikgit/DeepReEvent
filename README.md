# DeepReEvent

## Recurrent Event Analysis with Deep Learning

This Python package provides tools for analyzing recurrent events and terminal events using deep learning models. It is designed to facilitate easy modeling and prediction of recurrent event data, commonly encountered in fields such as healthcare, reliability engineering, and social sciences.

## Features

- **Model Training**: Train deep learning models on data involving recurrent and possibly terminal events.
- **Prediction**: Generate predictions for the time to next event and the risk of a terminal event.
- **Metrics Calculation**: Compute key survival analysis metrics like the concordance index, Brier score, and ROC AUC.
